1. What makes me proud of this piece of work?

    I'm proud of this project because of how impactful the Twitch platform has been personally, and how I was able to create a tool that could help people improve their streaming experience! The goal of improving the streaming and viewing experience was the inspiration behind this project, and the idea that this project could be used to improve streamer-viewer interaction and make people more entertained is what makes me especially proud of this work.

2. What areas of this project did I specifically work on?  

    I worked on everything in this project by myself. From creating the API wrappers to managing the database and everything in-between.

    It initially started as a simple API wrapper for the Twitch API with basic commands like uptime, title, and followage, but then evolved to include features such as custom commands, repeated commands at specified intervals, and stream management commands. 

    I'm also still thinking about ways to grow this project even further! The next steps I'm thinking about are adding Spotify integration so viewers can get the current song that's playing, and adding a front-end dashboard so streamers have an easier and more friendly UI to work with (instead of being constrained inside Twitch chat).


3. What did I learn throughout this project?  

    I learned a lot about web development and furthered my Javascript knowledge! This was my first time using Node.js and MongoDB, so there was a lot of time spent on StackOverflow and reading the framework documentation to get familiar with the technologies. 
    
    Technology-wise, I learned a lot about making HTTP requests, how promises work, using asynchronous functions and the await keywBaseBaseord, as well as MongoDB integration and how to manage data stored in a NoSQL database.

    Non-technology wise, I improved upon my time-management skills and organizational skills by apply agile development practices. By scheduling sprints and creating tasks for each sprint, I held myself accountable and made sure that consistent progress was being made on the project. Creating sprint tasks also helped me improve my systems design skills, and how I would often revise certain parts of the project to better align with the bigger picture and the entire project as a whole.
    
     

4. What was the most interesting thing about working on this?


    I think the most interesting thing about working on this project is the fact that there is a ton of potential for this project to grow, and that there are a whole bunch of features you could add to help improve the stream chat experience! Besides Spotify integration, you could add game-specific commands (League of Legends rank, Overwatch character statistics), implement chat games (trivia, roll the dice), emote specific actions, and more! 
    
    There are so many directions you can end up taking this project, and I find the lack of restriction to be one of the most interesting parts about working on this project. You can let your mind run free, and add whatever feature you want in the hopes of adding to the user experience.
